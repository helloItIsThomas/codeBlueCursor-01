we have a total triangle count.
each triangle moves outward from the origin.
the origin is the mouse position.

I want to instantiate a triangle at a given mouse position,
then have it's origin pinned at that position, until it reaches the radius value.

i think we need to have some concept of what an instantiation is, 
since we always have a set number of triangles.
Instantiation is when the radius value wraps back to 0.

maybe we have a max number,
and that max number defines the size of instancePositionBuffer and alphaBuffer.

Then we have a way to determine if triangles are active or not.
if they are not active, they are at the origin and have an alpha value of 0.
When they are instantiated, they are activated and animate until they reach the radius,
then they are de-activated.

They are acitvated when the mouse velocity is above a certain threshold.
But, for now, we can activate them on mouse press.
